### Road Anomaly Image Classification

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on classifying road anomalies (potholes, garbage, fallen trees) from images. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of these anomalies, organized into respective folders. CSV files provide image paths and corresponding labels for training and testing sets. 

**Dataset**
* **Image Structure:** Images are categorized into folders based on anomaly type (pothole, garbage, fallen tree).
* **CSV Files:** Training and testing sets are represented as CSV files with 'image_path' and 'label' columns.
* **Data Splitting:** The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, maintaining a balanced distribution of anomaly types.

**Methodology**
* **Image Preprocessing:** Images are loaded, resized, and preprocessed for model input.
* **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can be applied to increase data variability.
* **Model Architecture:** A suitable deep learning model (e.g., CNN, ResNet) will be implemented for image classification.
* **Training:** The model is trained on the training dataset using appropriate optimization and loss functions.
* **Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Future Work**
* Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters.
* Explore advanced techniques like transfer learning and data imbalance handling.
* Develop a real-time implementation for anomaly detection in live video streams.

**Dependencies**
* TensorFlow/Keras
* OpenCV (optional, for image processing)
* Pandas (for CSV handling)
* Other necessary libraries

**Note:** This README will be updated as the project progresses.

**Additional Information**
* Detailed explanations and comments are included within the code.
* Hyperparameters and configuration details are documented.
